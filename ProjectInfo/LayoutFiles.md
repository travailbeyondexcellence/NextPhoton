Yes, you're absolutely right — that's **exactly how it works** in the **Next.js App Router**.

### ✅ Core Concept: Nested Layouts

When you have:

```
app/
├── layout.tsx                ← 🔵 Root layout (applies globally)
├── (dashboard)/layout.tsx    ← 🟢 Child layout (dashboard-specific)
│   ├── admin/page.tsx
│   ├── learner/page.tsx
├── (onboarding)/layout.tsx   ← 🟡 Child layout (onboarding-specific)
├── (public)/layout.tsx       ← 🟠 Child layout (public pages)
```

Each layout **wraps** the content of its subroutes — and the root layout wraps **everything** underneath.

---

### 🧠 What Happens at Runtime?

When the user visits:
`/admin`

The rendering flow is:

```jsx
<RootLayout>                    // app/layout.tsx
  <DashboardLayout>            // app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx
    <AdminPage />              // app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx
  </DashboardLayout>
</RootLayout>
```

So yes: **dashboard layout is nested inside the root layout**, and each page/component is rendered within that.

---

### 🔁 Same Logic for Other Groups

* `/onboarding` → `RootLayout → OnboardingLayout → OnboardingPage`
* `/pricing` → `RootLayout → PublicLayout → PricingPage`

---

### 🔒 Side Note: Global Providers in Root Layout

If you use the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) for things like:

* `<html>` and `<body>`
* Theme providers
* Toast providers
* Global font CSS
* Head meta tags

…they’ll be applied **across the whole app**, and nested layouts won’t override them unless explicitly done.

---

### ✅ Summary

| Layout File                   | Role                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `app/layout.tsx`              | Global wrapper for all routes         |
| `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`  | Nested layout for dashboard routes    |
| `app/(onboarding)/layout.tsx` | Nested layout for onboarding          |
| `app/(public)/layout.tsx`     | Nested layout for public-facing pages |
