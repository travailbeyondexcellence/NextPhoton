# NextPhoton Features Documentation

This folder contains detailed documentation about NextPhoton features organized by implementation status and timeline.

## Feature Documentation Structure

### üìã Feature Status Categories

#### 1. **pdfeatures-implemented.md**
**Features that are already implemented and running in the project**
- Production-ready features currently live in the platform
- Fully tested and deployed functionality
- User-accessible features with complete implementation
- Documentation includes implementation details, usage guidelines, and maintenance notes

#### 2. **pdfeatures-current.md** 
**Features that we are implementing right now**
- Active development features being worked on currently
- Features in progress during live development sessions
- Real-time implementation status and progress updates
- Includes current blockers, next steps, and completion estimates

#### 3. **pdfeatures-next.md**
**Features that are about to be implemented or next to be implemented**
- Priority features queued for immediate development
- Features planned for the next development sprint/cycle
- Detailed implementation plans and requirements ready
- Dependencies resolved and ready for development start

#### 4. **Long-term Features** ‚Üí `../roadmap.md`
**Future features and strategic development plans**
- Long-term strategic features and enhancements
- Features requiring significant planning or research
- Future integrations and platform expansions
- Innovation opportunities and experimental features

## Feature Documentation Guidelines

### Documentation Format
Each feature document should include:
- **Feature Name**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Status**: Current implementation status
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low priority classification
- **Description**: Detailed feature explanation and value proposition
- **Requirements**: Technical and business requirements
- **Dependencies**: Required components, integrations, or prerequisites
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical approach and considerations
- **Testing Criteria**: Acceptance criteria and testing requirements

### Status Tracking
- **Implemented**: ‚úÖ Feature complete and deployed
- **Current**: üîÑ In active development
- **Next**: ‚è≥ Queued for immediate implementation
- **Roadmap**: üó∫Ô∏è Long-term planning stage

### Update Frequency
- **pdfeatures-implemented.md**: Updated when features are completed and deployed
- **pdfeatures-current.md**: Updated continuously during development sessions
- **pdfeatures-next.md**: Updated when features move from planning to development queue
- **roadmap.md**: Updated monthly or during strategic planning sessions

## Integration with Main Documentation

### Cross-References
Feature documentation integrates with:
- **pd-technical-architecture.md**: Technical implementation details
- **pd-workflows.md**: User experience and operational processes
- **pd-analytics.md**: Feature success metrics and tracking
- **pd-roles-permissions.md**: Role-specific feature access and permissions

### Development Workflow
1. **Planning**: Features start in roadmap.md or pdfeatures-next.md
2. **Development**: Move to pdfeatures-current.md during active work
3. **Completion**: Move to pdfeatures-implemented.md when deployed
4. **Maintenance**: Reference pdfeatures-implemented.md for ongoing support

This structured approach ensures clear visibility into feature development progress, facilitates better project planning, and provides comprehensive documentation for all platform capabilities.
